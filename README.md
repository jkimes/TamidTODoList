ToDO List Tech Lead App

This Website Utlizes React and MongoDB to make a to do list

To start the app navigate to "index.js" inside of the "server" folder and in the terminal type "npm run devStart" to start the server. Then in the "to-do-list" folder do npm start to boot up the website

You can type todo items into to the top input box and select "ADD" then refresh the page to add the item to the list underneath.
Todo items can be deleted by selecting the green box with an "X"
The update function is currently bugged
